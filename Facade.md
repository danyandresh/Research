###Facade

_Structural_ pattern

> Provides an interface through which various objects in a complex subsystem are manipulated

####Components

* **Facade** Contract for the complex subsystem
* **Subsystem Classes** Components of a complex subsystem

####Similar patterns

* **Bridge**: `bridge` is another pattern meant to isolate subsystems, with the difference that `facade` simplifies access to a subsystem, doesn't hide it
* **Mediator**: `mediator`s comprise complex, bidirectional communication with other components
